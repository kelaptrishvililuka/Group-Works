            <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng,
                literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the
                historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
                nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century
                BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.
                Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple
                stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty
                (1368–1644).

                Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the
                imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and
                the control of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great
                Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling
                capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also
                served as a transportation corridor.

                The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from
                Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to
                Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe;
                spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is
                generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.

            <p>Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France and Édouard
                Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May,
                Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the
                exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries
                had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[11] (A
                300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.) On 12 May, a commission was set up
                to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except
                Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.

            <p>
                A French bank, the Crédit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel
                Tower. During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans
                to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower. These loans were
                connected to an indemnity controversy that saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate
                French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the
                CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, "effectively choking off the nation's
                primary source of income". According to The New York Times, "[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping
                finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it
                was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its
                ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country."

            <p>
                The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe
                it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no
                structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[14] and many
                people believed it was impossible. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in
                France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at
                the Champ de Mars: a "Committee of Three Hundred" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was
                formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures
                of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A
                petition called "Artists against the Eiffel Tower" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner
                for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:

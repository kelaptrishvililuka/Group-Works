            <p>The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[9] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the
                tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its
                construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made
                structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was
                finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre
                mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now
                taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the
                second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.

                The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top
                level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground—the highest observation deck accessible to the
                public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and
                second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from
                the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is a staircase
                to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment
                built for Gustave Eiffel's personal use. He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited
                friends such as Thomas Edison.

                The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior
                engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about
                a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the
                centennial of the French Revolution. In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea,
                described by him as "a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and
                coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals".[10] Eiffel initially
                showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen
                Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre
                added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other
                embellishments.

                The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which
                Koechlin, Nouguier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of
                Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his
                plans to the Société des Ingénieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the
                practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise

            <p>Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France and Édouard
                Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May,
                Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the
                exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries
                had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[11] (A
                300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.) On 12 May, a commission was set up
                to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except
                Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.

                A French bank, the Crédit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel
                Tower. During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans
                to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower. These loans were
                connected to an indemnity controversy that saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate
                French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the
                CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, "effectively choking off the nation's
                primary source of income". According to The New York Times, "[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping
                finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it
                was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its
                ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country."

                The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe
                it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no
                structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[14] and many
                people believed it was impossible. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in
                France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at
                the Champ de Mars: a "Committee of Three Hundred" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was
                formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures
                of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A
                petition called "Artists against the Eiffel Tower" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner
                for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:
